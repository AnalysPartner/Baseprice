1: Cleans PIR data directly from SAP, you input the file you recieve from SAP after running the ZMMINFORECEXT 	transaction and the output is a Excel workbook with only fixed suppliers.<br>
2: Compares prices, suppliers and leadtime between the preconfigured baseprice list and the PIR-list.</p>
<h1 id="function-one-clean-pir">Function one: Clean PIR</h1>

Password is Swisslog, this is just a safety precaution to avoid misstakes.<br>
Now you have multiple options.<br>
<strong>Print</strong><br>
These are to bottom row buttons, select which record you want to print then select save location and the output is a Excel workbook in the correct format.<br>
<strong>Upload new</strong><br>
Press the “Activate buttons” button and then press ok on the prompt. (this is also just for safety to avoid misstakes)<br>
Select what record you want to upload.<br>
Note1: Good practice is to first make a copy by printing out old records.<br>
Note2: When you want to update a newer version of the records print the old one and just update the values, it is very important that the format stays the same.</p>
